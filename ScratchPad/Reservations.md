Hello Paul,

Firstly, thank you for booking your stay with us!

We would advise reading this whole message as it contains important info about your stay:

Directions & Check-in

The Cabin will be ready for you to check-in from 15:00 onwards with the latest check-in at 21:00. When arriving at the location of the cabin, there will be a red letterbox opposite the driveway with a black sign which says Coney Burrow.
Proceed down the driveway to which you will come across a house on the right hand side with black iron gates. Continue to follow the dirt track down passed the property.
Once you have passed the black gates at the bottom of the dirt track, turn right and you will see big white stones placed around 50yds from eachother down the dirt track to the cabin. Please follow these while taking in the beautiful woodland scenery.

When parked outside the cabin, there will be a lockbox on the left side of the door to the entrance, the code to this is 2381. The keys inside are for the entrance and balcony of the cabin. Please look after these keys and return to lockbox upon departure, check-out is 10:00. Failure to leave keys will result in a charge.

Full address:
Coney Burrow
Street End Lane
Heathfield
TN21 8TU


Welcome Pack & Extra Info

- We have created a welcome pack (Grey folder to the right as you come in the entrance) for you to read if you wish to know about the surrounding area of things to do or places to eat! You can however choose to stay in the secluded location and be at one with nature.

- The Cabin’s electricity and hot water is powered by a generator, this is controlled with a fob attached to the keys inside of the lockbox. To turn the generator ON you will need to click the right button TWICE. (You should hear the generator turn on from outside!) We would kindly ask that when either electricity or hot water isn’t required to turn the generator OFF by clicking the left button ONCE. (Again, you will hear this turn off from outside!) The generator will have enough fuel in to run for 18 hours, please be mindful of this during your stay on how long you leave this running for.
Those on a longer stay who may require more fuel to the generator, you may see a gentleman by the name of ‘Bunny’ come down to top up the generator with fuel, please don’t be alarmed if you see him!

- An endless supply of logs will be provided to those wanting to use the log burner, there are fire lighters under the sink.

- Please leave all furniture including beds as they are.

- It’s worth noting some mobile networks DON’T have coverage at the location of the cabin, perfect for those wanting to get away from it all!

Most importantly, we hope you have a wonderful stay!

Kind Regards,
Tom, Ash & Bunny
